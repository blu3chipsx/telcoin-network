# How TN CI Works

GitHub actions takes over 45 minutes to build and test the workspace (before fmt or clippy lint checks).

Instead of relying on cloud infrastructure, the core team is responsible for submitting an attestation transaction to the git commit hash attestation contract (currently deployed at `0xde9700e89e0999854e5bfd7357a803d8fc476bb0`).

The worker takes the HEAD commit hash and verifies an attestation was pushed on-chain.

## Environment
Attesting devs must have "MAINTAINER" role to update contract state.

The local `test-and-attest.sh` script requires Foundry's cast.

See https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation for installation instructions.

Add `GITHUB_ATTESTATION_PRIVATE_KEY` to a `.env` file in the project. This is the private key (without "0x" prefix) associated with the "MAINTAINER" role address.

## Toolchain pins

Two channels are pinned in the repo root:

- **`rust-toolchain.toml`** — stable channel (currently `1.94`). Used for all compile/test commands. rustup auto-honors it inside the repo, so bare `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo check`, and `cargo nextest` use stable 1.94.
- **`rust-nightly`** — single-line file containing the nightly date (currently `nightly-2026-03-20`). Used only for `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`, which require nightly-only rustfmt/clippy options (`imports_granularity`, `wrap_comments`, etc.). The Makefile, `etc/test-and-attest.sh`, and CI workflows read this file and invoke `cargo +<date>` explicitly.

To bump nightly: edit `rust-nightly`. To bump stable: edit `rust-toolchain.toml` (and align with `Cargo.toml`'s `rust-version` and `etc/Dockerfile`'s base image tag).
